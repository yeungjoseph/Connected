Othello GUI
--
This was a requried project for ICS 32 (Programming with software libraries).
The assignment included developing the game logic as well as the GUI built with Tkinter.
The sole reason for including this project on my GitHub is to contrast my method of approach
between solving 2D array traversals in Othello and Tic Tac Toe. I consider Othello to be my first
non-trivial sized project, so having the source code up is simply a good reminder of how far
I've grown as a programmer.
