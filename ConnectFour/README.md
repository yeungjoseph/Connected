Connect Four GUI 
--
This GUI for Connect Four is an extension of a class project I completed in ICS 32 (Programming with software libraries).
For the assignment, we were instructed to create a console interface for two players to play connect four, and had the game
logic provided by the professor. 
This extension of the project includes the original game logic, but the GUI is built with Tkinter, Python's standard GUI package.

This GUI implementation of Connect Four has these additional features:
-
-Dedicated play/quit button

-Top row of game board reflects current position of player's piece

-Pop up window that alerts the player when there is a winner
